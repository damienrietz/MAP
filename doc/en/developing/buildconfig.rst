.. module:: mapstore.buildconfig   :synopsis: Manage Build Configuration.. _mapstore.buildconfig:Manage Build Configuration==========================| When building MapStore all the plugins and widget used are merged together in a single file.| To specify which components to add in the build, a `buildjs.cfg` is used.| The `buildjs.cfg` has a list of every plugin, widget or library to look for when buildingThe `buildjs.cfg` file is placed in the root directory of either `mapcomposer` and `mapmanager`::	    ../mapstore/	        mapcomposer	            buildjs.cfg	        mapmanager	            buildjs.cfgIn the following example we will add the `Geolocate` plugin to the build file#. | The `Geolocate` plugin uses an OpenLayers Control, also called `Geolocate` that must be included in the build file as well   | Open the `buildjs.cfg` file and find the **[OpenLayers.js]** section   #. After the `include=` line add the following    ::	OpenLayers/Control/Geolocate.js#. In the same file find the **[gxp.js]** section and, again, under the `include=` line add the following    ::	plugins/Geolocate.js#. Now the `Geolocate` plugin will be available in the MapStore build and can be instantiated in the config file with    ::	  {	      "ptype":"gxp_geolocate",	      "enableTracking" : false,	      "layerName": "Position",	      "bind": true,	      "zoom": true,	      "displayInLayerSwitcher": false,	      "geolocationStyles": {	          "pointStyle":{	                  "graphicName": "circle",	                  "strokeColor": "#aaa",	                  "fillColor": "#11f",	                  "strokeWidth": 2,	                  "fillOpacity": 0.7,	                  "strokeOpacity": 0.6,	                  "pointRadius": 5                          	          },"auraStyle":{	                  "fillOpacity": 0.3,	                  "fillColor": "#55b",	                  "strokeColor": "#00f",	                  "strokeOpacity": 0.6	          },	      "geolocationOptions": {	              "enableHighAccuracy": true,	              "maximumAge": 0,	              "timeout": 7000	          }	      },	      "actionTarget":{	          "target":"paneltbar",	          "index": 22	      }	  }    Please refer to the :ref:`Manage Viewer Configuration<mapstore.viewerconfig>` section for more information
